imhistR is the easy image processing tool. This package focussed for Luminance, RGB, Lab, and HSB(HSV) with image. 
It motivated to visualize image color information. 

It have two main goals:

* Draw an image histogram quickly in R.

* Calculate their descriptive stastics (Mean, SD, Skewness, Kurtsis) by one command.

Install:

* The latest development version get from github with

    ```R
    if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
    devtools::install_github("mokazuma/imhistR")
    ```

* Usage example: 

    ```R
    require("imhistR")
    lrgbhist(input="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png", 
             mode="url", output="Rlogo", endoff=TRUE)
    ```

You get an image histogram and their descriptive stastics.
